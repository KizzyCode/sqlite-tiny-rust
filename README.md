# `sqlite-tiny`
Welcome to `sqlite-tiny` ðŸŽ‰

This crate is minimalistic SQLite library crate which ships the amalgamation variant and provides a tiny Rust API. If
you just want the embedded SQLite library plus the generated C bindings, you can disable the `api`-feature (enabled by
default).

## Performance Considerations
For the sake of simplicity, this crate operates under the following assumption: `malloc` is cheap. To keep the code
clean and readable, we are quite liberal with allocating memory and copying data to avoid overly complex life-time
juggling.

Some locations where we do this are (non-exhaustive):
- Binding values: Since some values require a temporary intermediate representation before they can be bound, and
  statements should be able to outlive a passed argument, we instruct SQLite to copy the values into an internal buffer
- Reading values: To avoid lifetime troubles, we always copy a value from a row/column out of the SQLite context into 
  Rust-managed memory immediately on access

## Distributed SQLite Version
For simplicity, this crate does not link to external SQLite versions, but exclusively builds and embeds the amalgamation
in the [`dist`-folder](dist/). For more information see [`dist/README.md`](dist/README.md).
